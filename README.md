# AI-Driven-Safe-Data-Migration


## 📌 Project Description
This repository contains a **fully developed and working implementation** of a user-controlled
data migration system with **automatic error detection, alerting, and resume capability**.

The complete source code for the system is provided below in this repository and is
**ready to run, deploy, and extend**.

The project demonstrates how real-world data migrations are safely handled in
production environments to prevent data loss and ensure operational control.
